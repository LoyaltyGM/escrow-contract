# Introduction

Escrow Smart Contract is a cutting-edge, decentralized, and trustless solution that revolutionizes the way individuals engage in peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges, ensuring the security and transparency of each transaction. Built on the sui blockchain, this smart contract introduces a versatile and adaptable escrow mechanism, allowing for seamless 1-to-1, 1-to-many, and many-to-many exchanges of sui objects.

It is a contract between two parties, where one party (the creator) deposits items and/or a specified token (SUI), and the other party (the recipient) deposits items and/or a specified amount of SUI. The items deposited must be of type T.

## Initialization Functions

`init(otw: ESCROW, ctx: &mut TxContext)`

- `otw`: Represents the One Time Witness struct
- `ctx`: Represents the transaction context containing information about the current transaction.

- `admin_cap`: Represents the administrative capability required for certain administrative functions.
- `hub`: Represents the EscrowHub instance that will have its fee updated.
- `fee`: The new fee amount in SUI to be set for creating an Escrow.

Updates the fee for creating an Escrow. This function can only be called by an address with administrative capability (`admin_cap`). The `fee` parameter represents the new fee amount in SUI.  

<br>

`withdraw(admin_cap: &AdminCap, hub: &mut EscrowHub,ctx: &mut TxContext)`

- `admin_cap`: Represents the administrative capability required for certain administrative functions.
- `hub`: Represents the EscrowHub instance from which the accumulated fee balance will be withdrawn.
- `ctx`: Represents the transaction context containing information about the current transaction.

Withdraws the accumulated fee balance from the EscrowHub. This function can only be called by an address with administrative capability (`admin_cap`). The withdrawn amount will be sent to the caller's address.

`migrate_hub(admin_cap: &AdminCap, hub: &mut EscrowHub)`

- `admin_cap`: Represents the administrative capability required for certain administrative functions.
- `hub`: Represents the EscrowHub instance that will be migrated to the current contract version.

Migrates the EscrowHub to the current contract version. This function can only be called by an address with administrative capability (`admin_cap`). It updates the `version` of the EscrowHub to the current contract version.

## Escrow’s Creator Functions

`create<T: key + store>(hub: &mut EscrowHub, creator_items: vector<T>, creator_coin: Coin<SUI>, recipient: address, recipient_items_ids: vector<ID>, recipient_coin_amount: u64, ctx: &mut TxContext)`

- `creator_items`: A vector of items of type T deposited by the creator of the Escrow.
- `creator_coin`: The amount of SUI deposited by the creator of the Escrow.
- `recipient`: The address of the recipient of the Escrow.
- `recipient_items_ids`: A vector of IDs representing items that the recipient should deposit.
- `recipient_coin_amount`: The amount of SUI that the recipient should deposit.
- `ctx`: Represents the transaction context containing information about the current transaction.

Creates a new Escrow instance with the specified parameters. The caller of this function becomes the creator of the Escrow. The `creator_items` parameter is a vector of items of type T deposited by the creator. The `creator_coin` parameter is the amount of SUI deposited by the creator. The `recipient` parameter is the address of the recipient of the Escrow. The `recipient_items_ids` parameter is a vector of IDs representing items that the recipient should deposit. The `recipient_coin_amount` parameter is the amount of SUI that the recipient should deposit.

- `hub`: Represents the EscrowHub instance from which the Escrow will be canceled.
- `escrow_id`: The ID of the Escrow to be canceled.
- `ctx`: Represents the transaction context containing information about the current transaction.

Cancels an existing Escrow. This function can only be called by the creator of the Escrow. The `escrow_id` parameter specifies the ID of the Escrow to be canceled. The items and SUI deposited by the creator will be returned to them.

## Escrow’s Recipient Functions

`exchange<T: key + store>(hub: &mut EscrowHub, fee_coin: Coin<SUI>, escrow_id: ID, recipient_items: vector<T>, recipient_coin: Coin<SUI>, ctx: &mut TxContext)`

- `hub`: Represents the EscrowHub instance containing the Escrow to be exchanged.
- `fee_coin`: The amount of SUI paid as a fee for the exchange.
- `escrow_id`: The ID of the Escrow to be exchanged.
- `recipient_items`: A vector of items of type T deposited by the recipient for the exchange.
- `recipient_coin`: The amount of SUI deposited by the recipient for the exchange.
- `ctx`: Represents the transaction context containing information about the current transaction.
